            <h1>Real Estate Agents</h1>
            <p>
                We assist Real Estate Agents by helping their clients remove unnecessary items
                from their residence prior to listing their property.
                We can also assist with the removal of items that have been left behind
                once the property has been sold, including household hazardous materials.
            </p>
            <h1>Property Managers and Multi-Family Housing </h1>
            <p>
                We provide trash-out and clean-out services for property managers and multi-family
                housing maintenance crews when properties turn over and junk needs to be removed
                from the property or unit before a new tenant can move in.
            </p>
            <h1>Professional Offices</h1>
            <p>
                We assist companies with the removal, donation, and disposal of used office furniture
                and other unwanted items. Common removals include desks, filing cabinets, printers,
                and copy machines. We can also accommodate weekend and after hours requests to avoid
                disruption.
